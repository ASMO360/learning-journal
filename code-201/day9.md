## slightly distracted

This afternoon, I found myself distracted during lab.  I am going into court tomorrow morning over a family law matter.  
I feel like this week I have been on the right path to figure out the solution to the lab problem, but never quite getting it.  I know that I will overcome this soon.  I have been reassured that I am grasping the concepts which is very encouraging.  This encouragement also drives me to grind towards a solution.  This week is a tough week for many reasons.  I am looking forward to next week.
