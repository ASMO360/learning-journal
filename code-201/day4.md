##Pairs, Apples and Bananas

Like a closer in baseball,  today was a new day and I had the opportunity to obtain a win.
We worked in pairs with pair programming.  One person was the "driver" and the other was
the "navigator".  I worked with Adam who is super cool and we had a good time working on the project.
