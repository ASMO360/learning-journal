# Joshua Fredrickson's Code201 Learning Journal
### November 22

## Dancing with code.

Today, I took two steps forward!  I was able to finish Monday's and Tuesday assignment!
I also took the step of going into Code301 in a month after I take care of some legal matters.
I will use this opportunity to strengthen my code and look into the future educational topics.
