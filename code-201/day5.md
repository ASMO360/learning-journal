## Feeling better!

Today I felt well about applying the concepts into the lab.  I can tell that I
will need to be thorough with ensuring my comprehension on problems.  I do feel
great about how my progress improving on the labs.  While I have a lot to make up
from Wednesday, I think that I am getting myself set up for overall success.  
even with the expectation that this Wednesday is going to be hard.  I am looking
forward to the challenge.
