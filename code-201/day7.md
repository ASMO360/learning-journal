## In the eye of the storm

Today, I reached out to some of the other students and the TA's after not producing any good fruit on Monday's lab.  While I am finding the class definitely has some cliques.  I have found that the most helpful students are not apart of these groups.  The TA's have been extremely helpful and my best resource.  I am slowly coming along, but I am still trying to catch up.  I am trying to build a house with a hammer, while others have a pneumatic nailer.  I can still get the work done, but it takes me more time.
