## teamwork!

Today was a good day.  I worked together with Adam and Yohanes on the Chocolate Pizza lab assignment.
The guys were great teammates!  Yohanes was the driver during this project while Adam and I pushed content to Yohanes.  We outlined who was responsible for different sections and meshed very well.
