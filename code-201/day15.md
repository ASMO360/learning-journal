## What a journey so far.

As I reflect back, I am very happy with the amount of information I learn.  The stacked learning process definitely works!  I am also looking forward to working on my skills during the month that I am not taking classes at Code Fellows.  I feel like this is the first vista on a hike up a very tall mountain.
