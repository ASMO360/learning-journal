## *Oh boy!  Loops through me for a Loop today*
I had thought that I had a good understanding of loops in the Code 102 course,
but it seemed like all of that information went out the window today.  I was
having issues with my logic.  I remember that logic was not a strong suit for me
when I was in high school.  I will need to double my efforts on improving my
logic skills.  It's been a long day today.  I am going to keep this entry short
so I can get some sleep.

I am looking forward to trusting the process and improving myself tomorrow.
