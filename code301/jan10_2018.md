# Code 301 day 2

## ummmm Jeff, It's no longer "day one"....

Today's lab didn't move at the pace that I would have wished for.  But, I did learn a few things and working with Gene was a pleasure.  My mind has been divided with my court hearing tomorrow morning, so I am looking forward to being done with court tomorrow and moving forward.  I lamented that in today's lab I created jQuery code that Brian said is NOT best practice.  Good to know!
