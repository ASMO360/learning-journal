#Joshua Fredrickson's 301 Learning Journal

##yes Jeff... today is Day One... again

I am eagerly ready to embark on another Code Fellows Journey into the land of Javascript.  Today was a light day with little work being day one and all.  I was happy to see Nicole and Wyatt from my 201 course.  I am very excited to learn from my instructor Brian.  I had a sneak preview on the 2nd day of my 201 course when Brian was the substitute instructor for the lecture.  I enjoy his professional insights and straight forward attitude.
