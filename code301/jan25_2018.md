# Joshua Fredrickson's 301 Learning Journal

## Swimming through "it"

I am at the phase of feeling a day or two behind in comprehending the concepts being presented.  Moving through week 3, I feel that we are slowly moving forward, but knowing where to apply the new information of from this weeks learning into our code.  At a high level I feel like I understand the concepts, but when I am in the middle of a lab, that is where the struggle is.  Learning the problem solving logic has been my struggle at my time here at Code Fellows.  I also feel that this struggle is going to grow into a strength.  I look forward to Project Week and Code 401.
