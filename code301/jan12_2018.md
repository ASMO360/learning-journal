#Code 301 day 5

##"keeeeeep going!" - Tom Cervosky

Today's lab was enjoyable in the fact that we finished at a record pace for me.  My partners were working faster than what I was comprehending.  I asked some questions to clarify stuff.  I think if I was on a 1 on 1 team I would have learned more info.  With  that, I look forward to the weekend and processing the information a little bit before week 2.  :)
